#Video Player

My name is Santiago Moliner, I’m a student at the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM. This is my personal research about a functional video player inside Visual Studio C++ using SDL Library and ffmpeg libraries.


##Introduction:

In this research project, i will teach you how you can implement a video player in your C++ code using the SDL Library and ffmpeg libraries, implementing a module that can reproduce AVI files. Video Playing inside your game is a complex task, and there are many ways of implementing a video player inside.I have chosen one that i could understand with my programming knowledge.

##Pre-rendered cutscenes vs Real Time cutscenes:

In video games cutscenes can be classified in many ways, but when talking about video rendering, there are two different categories: pre-rendered and real time cutscenes. Real time cutscenes use the game engine to generate a cutscene that is rendered while the game is playing. Pre-rendered cutscenes, as the name implies, are cutscenes that have been rendered before, and the game just plays the cutscene

###Example of Real Time cutscene:
